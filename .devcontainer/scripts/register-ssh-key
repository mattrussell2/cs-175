Hello! This script will:
1. generate your ssh public and private keys
2. register your public key with your account on the homework server

These steps will enable password-less access to the homework server from this development container. 

You may ignore warnings/error messages that arise, HOWEVER, please
1. enter 'yes' if asked
2. enter your password if prompted

Note that the password requested is NOT the one you use for sis.uit.tufts.edu -- see here for details: https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~accounts/
