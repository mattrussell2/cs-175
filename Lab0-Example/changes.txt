    Added gl_silence_deprecation define at top of file. 
    FL/glut.h -> FL/glut.H
    Made tabs 4 spaces
    Added comments to better describe the various classes used here. 
    Removed argc, argv from main(), as they are unused.

    Given the small size of the classes, moved definitions inside class... 
    I think this makes the code more readable w/ two classes in the one file. 

    MyGlCanvas:
     Created functions to set up opengl lights and camera, and called these 
         from a new function: establish_gl_context. 
     Made wireframe a bool...slightly easier to understand. 
   
    MyAppWindow:
     Removed unused void* userdata arguments from FL function parameters. 
     Cast FL::add_idle paramater to be (Fl_Idle_Handler)(void*) of the CB fn.
     Made pack a private member variable of the MyAppWindow class. 
     Made functions to create the various aspects of the pack, and called those
         functions from the MyAppWindow constructor. 
     Moved resizable() idle callback declaration into MyAppWindow constructor.
     Added variable 'status' to receive output of Fl::run()...it just makes it 
         clear that the run function runs, and it's status is returned. Not 
         super efficient, but probably more comprehensible.  
     Added MyAppWindow destructor. 
     Renamed 'pack' variable to be 'control_panel'. 
     Moved canvas and slider/button variables to private. 

  ((Would rather try to refer to canvas->whatever inside the CB fns, instead of
      having to do win->canvas->whatever, but CB function stuff with FLTK 
      makes it impossible, i think....))
